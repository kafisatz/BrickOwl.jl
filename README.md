# BrickOwl

## this is work in progress

Accessing BrickOwl API using Julia.
See main_script.jl and other *.jl files for example code

note: you need to write to the BrickOwl admins to get access to the Catalog API
The other APIs (user, wishlist and a few others) work by default (once you generated your API key)
